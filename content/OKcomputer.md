Hi, I would like to reimplement the game Downwell in the
The game is initially a mobile game with gameboy like control. It can be obtained from everywhere other than Xbox. 
I like the art and music of the game. 
It is just 3 Euro, try it.

If one have played it, they have probably noticed the following:
- there is no start game button, one just walk from above the well (the title page) and jump inside.
- Once inside game, one can only restart the game, and a restart send you to the first level, not the peaceful title page with grass, winds and moon. I appreciate that.
- Every shot causes tiny screen shake, and the bigger the shot burst, the bigger the shake, essential for character actions that feels right.
- every shot causes the character to stay bit longer in the air and might cause it to jump longer. It adds up the complexity of movement.
- Timevoid: Once entered, the time is stoped, all the things outside appears freezed to you. The music suddenly changes. The clear difference of vibe here allows players to adjust their pace here, and really this is the only place to take a breath.
- The game have a clear indication on the monster design: The turtle cannot be beaten with bullet, the jellyfishs and bats can be either shot dead or stepped on while the all-red monster (and they always have spike) can only be shot, stepping on them causes you damage.
- A Rogue-Like Algorithm that generates game at a certain difficulty (we just ensure that it comes with normal difficulty 6 out of 10 times, that should be fun.)

They are essential to reimplement the game, even though we might have different art style, the right feel.
